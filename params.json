It is intended to be a source of sample code for everyone to benefit from. You can make cool apps that use core features of this app and hopefully get more users because you built something cool.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you want to help out and fix some bugs, that would make my year :).\r\n\r\n## Helping out\r\n\r\nIf you want to fix bugs, I'll love you forever! If you would like to add some features, I may, or may not merge it. If I think it will really benefit the app, I will message you saying that it will be added, with you name in it. Check out the  [issues](https://github.com/indianpoptart/Parks-and-Recreation/issues) page if you would like to help out with the code, I'd greatly appreciate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe Parks and Rec  source code is released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/indianpoptart/Parks-and-Recreation/blob/master/LICENSE).\r\n\r\nWhile it is not strictly forbidden by the license, I would greatly appreciate it if you didn't redistribute this app exactly the way it is in the App Store. There's nothing stopping you, but please don't do it.\r\n\r\n## 3rd Party API's\r\n\r\nThanks to jsoup, I'm able to parse HTML on the main website for the app, Thanks [jsoup] (https://github.com/jhy/jsoup).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
