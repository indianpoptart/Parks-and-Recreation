<p><img src="http://images.nikhilp.org/pandr.png" alt="Pandr"></p>

<p>This app is for the Ridgefield Parks and Recreation customers in Ridgefield, Connecticut.
Parks and Rec provides all of the information a customer needs in one place.
With alerts of closings, the app provides an easy way to stay updated on events taking place at the Rec center.
This app is to be used by the members of the <a href="http://ridgefieldparksandrec.org/">Ridgefield Parks and Recreation Center</a> </p>

<a name="why-go-open-source" class="anchor" href="#why-go-open-source"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why go open source?</h2>

<p>Just cause I wanted to.</p>

<p>Nah, this app is open source since the app is already free. It is intended to be a source of sample code for everyone to benefit from. You can make cool apps that use core features of this app and hopefully get more users because you built something cool.</p>

<p>Also, if you want to help out and fix some bugs, that would make my year :).</p>

<p>If you want to fix bugs, I'll love you forever! If you would like to add some features, I may, or may not merge it. If I think it will really benefit the app, I will message you saying that it will be added, with you name in it. Check out the  <a href="https://github.com/indianpoptart/Parks-and-Recreation/issues">issues</a> page if you would like to help out with the code, I'd greatly appreciate it.</p>
